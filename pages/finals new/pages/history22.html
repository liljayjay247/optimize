                <p>The Internet as we know it really got started in the early 1960s. That was when J.C.R. Licklider — a
                    computer scientist with technology company Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN) — formulated a few unique
                    ideas about global networking in a series of memos, describing an<b> "Intergalactic Computer
                        Network."</b><br>
                    His idea: link computers together across the globe; and anybody near a computer could
                    share information. As it turns out, Licklider had the right idea at the right time. The Cold War had
                    the United States searching for a communication network that could survive a nuclear attack.”</p>

                        synchronize and layout a publication the way it has been envisioned. TBL created a markup
                        language that tells a web browser how to visually display a page the way the “author” envisioned
                        it.) </p>
